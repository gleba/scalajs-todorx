# The Scala.js tutorial

This is a [TodoMVC application](http://todomvc.com/) written in [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).

Fork (https://github.com/lihaoyi/workbench-example-app).
This application makes heavy use of Scalatags and Scala.Rx, with heavy use of the DOM via scala-js-dom, making it a good example of how reactive web pages could be built using ScalaJS, as well as use of standalone ScalaJS libraries.
